10/25/19,16:01,Elva Wilky,"Anyways technically the written piece wasn't entirely all about you, just a few aspects..😁"

10/25/19,19:07,AJoshi,"I thought I was going to read an objective account of how I come off to you, which scared me for some reason."
10/25/19,19:07,AJoshi,Which is why I really wanted to read it (because it scared me so much)
10/25/19,19:07,Elva Wilky,It's best this way..I'd want to see the reactions in your eyes as you read 
10/25/19,19:08,Elva Wilky,Oh my it was never my intention to frighten you 
10/25/19,19:10,Elva Wilky,So sorry for that must have totally been awkward for you

10/26/19,22:23,AJoshi,<Media omitted>
10/26/19,22:23,AJoshi,Why are you scared to ask?
10/26/19,22:24,AJoshi,"I've watched Season 1, 2, 6, 7, 8"
10/26/19,22:24,AJoshi,I had already read the books when I learned about the show so the first seasons were epic
10/26/19,22:24,AJoshi,A reenactment of what went on in my head
10/26/19,22:24,Elva Wilky,Because I know if you've watched it then I won't hear the end of it because I
10/26/19,22:25,Elva Wilky,...haven't watched it yet😁
10/26/19,22:25,AJoshi,"Don't even watch it, the ending ruins the entire show. If you're looking for some amazing books to read on the other hand..."
10/26/19,22:25,Elva Wilky,This the part you start wondering what I've been doing with my life
10/26/19,22:26,Elva Wilky,Yeah once got my hands on one of the books but could hardly finish it
10/26/19,22:26,Elva Wilky,But always the books are richer than films
10/26/19,22:28,Elva Wilky,wueh it's like you were directing from the comfort of your home
10/26/19,22:28,Elva Wilky,Btw what are you up to now...👀am sensing it's about your bedtime
10/27/19,10:41,AJoshi,"Naw, don't even watch it, it's not worth the letdown at the end"
10/27/19,10:41,AJoshi,Good morning 🌞
10/27/19,10:41,AJoshi,"Definitely, same goes for eh Harry Potter series"
10/27/19,10:42,AJoshi,Are you a Potter nerd?
10/27/19,10:42,AJoshi,"It was way past my bedtime, I had only stayed because food hadn't been served yet and I was hungry af"
10/27/19,10:42,Elva Wilky,Nah but my big sister is totally she's watched it like a zillion
10/27/19,10:43,AJoshi,Large gatherings with a lot of noise and stimulation are not my thing. I prefer showing up and dipping ASAP.
10/27/19,10:43,AJoshi,Are you a clubbing person?
10/27/19,10:43,Elva Wilky,Oh am psychic

10/27/19,17:00,AJoshi,Don't want to make a mess in my room
10/27/19,17:01,AJoshi,I was being sarcastic why would I be offended by a finger slip
10/27/19,17:02,AJoshi,I was looking for a GIF of the song but didn't get one so I settled for this boring one

10/27/19,17:36,Elva Wilky,😄😄😄
10/27/19,17:36,AJoshi,Because you're so much more than your physical appearance
10/27/19,17:37,Elva Wilky,Huhh nice save..ishh
10/27/19,17:37,AJoshi,"Does her name start with E, by any chance?"
10/27/19,17:37,Elva Wilky,Maybe 😁
10/27/19,17:37,AJoshi,"It's the truth, take it or leave it"
10/27/19,17:38,AJoshi,Around 50 hours to go
10/27/19,17:38,Elva Wilky,Lol elaborate
10/27/19,17:39,AJoshi,You're more than what you look like

10/27/19,17:41,Elva Wilky,He heee
10/27/19,17:41,AJoshi,It wasn't *that* bad
10/27/19,17:41,AJoshi,😂😂
10/27/19,17:41,Elva Wilky,Yea right
10/27/19,17:41,AJoshi,I really need a massage now
10/27/19,17:41,AJoshi,Actually I need to take a nap
10/27/19,17:41,Elva Wilky,Anyways it's easy to forget a face considering I have blank white profile pics
10/27/19,17:42,AJoshi,I'm talk to you in 20 minutes or 20 hours depending on whether my alarm goes off or not😂
10/27/19,17:43,Elva Wilky,If you forget my face again you can check my IG I think I still have similar posts there
10/27/19,17:44,Elva Wilky,Well as the saying goes there's more to a book than as judged by the cover 🤓
10/27/19,17:45,Elva Wilky,Oh there there
10/27/19,17:46,Elva Wilky,You do so..dunno how you do it you'd probably need 10-50 power naps a day to function as well as you trying to do much
10/27/19,17:49,Elva Wilky,It's cool..I'll be here waiting as I decide what to have for dinner🤔might probably take a similar 20min to 20hrs deciding on 🤣

10/27/19,23:21,AJoshi,"A lot of cliche sayings depict the world accurately. Unfortunately, we become deadened to their truth due to sheer, mind-numbing repetition"
10/27/19,23:22,AJoshi,I've spent the day setting up a system for organizing my life. Check out Getting Things Done by David Allen when you get the time.
10/27/19,23:22,AJoshi,😂😂
10/27/19,23:23,AJoshi,😭😭
10/27/19,23:23,Elva Wilky,Indeed

10/28/19,12:32,AJoshi,<Media omitted>
10/28/19,12:32,AJoshi,It's even better in person 🤩
10/28/19,12:33,AJoshi,Are you not a nature fan? 😱
10/28/19,12:33,AJoshi,I'm offended on behalf of nature
10/28/19,12:33,AJoshi,How dare you not love nature
10/28/19,12:33,AJoshi,We can't be friends
10/28/19,12:34,Elva Wilky,He hee I am but yet to reach your level of even taking pics of the sky on phone
10/28/19,12:35,Elva Wilky,Am more into the night sky view
10/28/19,12:35,Elva Wilky,This is perfect..we should trade places
10/28/19,12:41,AJoshi,😂😂😂
10/28/19,12:41,AJoshi,I'm trying to involve you and here you are shitting on my efforts
10/28/19,12:42,AJoshi,I love night skies too but I also have a thing for clouds
10/28/19,12:42,AJoshi,Their size dumbfounds me
10/28/19,12:42,AJoshi,The fact that they are so massive they can cover entire cities with a shadow is incredible
10/28/19,12:47,Elva Wilky,Lol dude you have an app that recognizes planets and type of stars in the sky...that's like A1 level😵
10/28/19,12:49,Elva Wilky,Uuuh cloud watching is an art #esp on acid ps. _gosh the number of times I refer this pill is enough to get me in rehab_
10/28/19,12:49,Elva Wilky,Always waited to bottle a cloud when on plane
10/28/19,12:50,Elva Wilky,Mmh my wonder is often on how I an store one😁
10/28/19,12:51,AJoshi,<Media omitted>
10/28/19,12:51,AJoshi,"Please go to rehab, I think you're addicted to the idea of acid if not the drug itself"
10/28/19,12:51,Elva Wilky,Anyways considering your INTP is the rarest in the world..makes sense 🧐
10/28/19,12:52,AJoshi,😀😀
10/28/19,12:52,AJoshi,👀
10/28/19,12:53,Elva Wilky,Ooi indeed
10/28/19,12:53,AJoshi,"Technically I'm third rarest, 1st is INFJ, 2nd is INTJ, 3rd is INTP"
10/28/19,12:53,AJoshi,INTJ and INTP females are also pretty rare
10/28/19,12:54,Elva Wilky,What's that🤔
10/28/19,12:54,Elva Wilky,Close enough
10/28/19,12:54,AJoshi,"INTP females have it really bad because us types don't feel emotion. Men can get away with that, but women often go through stigma (both societal and self-imposed) and often feel like there's something very wrong with them because they can't (consciously) experience emotions"
10/28/19,12:55,Elva Wilky,I suspect my siz is one
10/28/19,12:55,AJoshi,<Media omitted>
10/28/19,12:56,AJoshi,When you can't type in a manner that makes sense
10/28/19,12:57,Elva Wilky,<Media omitted>
10/28/19,12:58,Elva Wilky,I could donate them some of my emotions for free😩
10/28/19,12:59,Elva Wilky,Oh yea stay tuned I'll be doing that alot so youll have to be smart enough to read right between the lines..the ffs happens when I overlapping ideas to text just waiting in line
10/28/19,13:00,Elva Wilky,🤣Dunno if that sense makes
10/28/19,13:05,Elva Wilky,Ooi maybe for a magical wish list's..that's quite impossible
10/28/19,16:35,AJoshi,😂😂😂
10/28/19,16:35,AJoshi,You could donate some to me as well
10/28/19,16:35,AJoshi,Everything's struggling to push out of your head at once so stuff gets mangled? 😂
10/28/19,16:35,Elva Wilky,Oh nooo not you too😫
10/28/19,16:35,AJoshi,Don't worry it makes sense

10/28/19,16:37,AJoshi,Sometimes they are harder to find but when you hit the sweet spot and she starts screaming your name and scratching your back -
10/28/19,16:38,Elva Wilky,Aaah like during a mountain climb

10/28/19,19:44,AJoshi,It's called being horny
10/28/19,19:44,AJoshi,Exactly
10/28/19,19:50,AJoshi,I'm back at the temple for New Year's celebrations but I really don't want to be here
10/28/19,19:50,AJoshi,I'm tired af and have better things to do than socialize 😭😭

10/28/19,22:09,Elva Wilky,That makes it interesting'er
10/28/19,22:09,AJoshi,My parents are still at the temple. I feel so old coming home early while my parents are out enjoying😂
10/28/19,22:09,Elva Wilky,Gottit...it's already 10pm
10/28/19,22:09,AJoshi,"Insert cliche ""old soul"" comment here"

10/29/19,09:24,AJoshi,I seriously need to figure out why I'm so tired all the time
10/29/19,09:24,AJoshi,Why do I have my doubts about you sleeping at this time??🤨
10/29/19,09:29,Elva Wilky,Woww you're such a great descripive writer..I should hide my face lol am often only gòod with narative writing..

10/29/19,09:33,Elva Wilky,Why would you
10/29/19,13:00,AJoshi,😀😀
10/29/19,13:00,AJoshi,And how do you know that vampires aren't aliens and that Leo isn't the prince of vampires 
10/29/19,13:02,AJoshi,Also you can do the narratives while I do the descriptions
10/29/19,13:03,AJoshi,Unfortunately I'm a shitty supernatural being who doesn't glitter in the sunlight (a lá Twilight) and needs to sleep all the time
10/29/19,13:03,AJoshi,I knew someone who would wake up at 4 to smoke at 4.20 every morning
10/29/19,13:04,AJoshi,I'd hear him outside my door talking bullshit😂😂 he would say the funniest shit ever
10/29/19,13:51,Elva Wilky,Lol can't even smoke a blunt decently🤣
10/29/19,13:52,Elva Wilky,Yea 4:20 stoners are an interesting breed
10/29/19,13:52,Elva Wilky,If only you could donate some of that sleep
10/29/19,13:52,Elva Wilky,Indeed 😃
10/29/19,13:53,Elva Wilky,Lol I get overloads of storylines..sometimes my beginnings don't relate to the endings

10/29/19,14:06,Elva Wilky,Aye
10/29/19,18:55,AJoshi,"I'll be in Nairobi by 9.30/10. I'll give you a call when I'm at Safari Park, then we can meet at Blue"
10/29/19,18:55,AJoshi,"Good news, my room is ready!!!"
10/29/19,18:55,AJoshi,It would be all yours
10/29/19,18:55,AJoshi,I think it's because of excessive screen time. I probably need to do something about that
10/29/19,18:56,AJoshi,I smell a collab in the works
10/29/19,18:56,AJoshi,😂😂😂
10/29/19,18:56,AJoshi,Who's we? 👀
10/29/19,18:57,AJoshi,That will be self defeating since I'm texting her right now
10/29/19,18:57,AJoshi,Does thee wish to cast thy spell upon thine own self?

11/25/19,21:18,AJoshi,Suggestion accepted. I talked about doing this a while back but it was one of my passing fancies and I didn't make it happen. We'll do this.

12/31/19,14:41,AJoshi,Not usually a big fan of African dishes but I've had some that drove me crazy
12/31/19,14:42,AJoshi,The guy who worked at Jimax (The chips place) made mindblowing food when he started then quality drifted off
12/31/19,14:42,AJoshi,I told him I'd Pay him to Cool daily for him but he didn't have the equipment
12/31/19,14:43,AJoshi,Between the cold and phone loss I didn't make it
12/31/19,14:43,AJoshi,I'll send pics from last year
12/31/19,14:44,AJoshi,"How many people do the work? Mostly women, am I right?"
12/31/19,14:44,AJoshi,You seem like an arrangement kind of girl😃 I bet you love that
12/31/19,14:45,AJoshi,Your dad is really community oriented

12/31/19,16:28,AJoshi,Sounds like something I would do 😂
12/31/19,16:28,AJoshi,"Both have their own vibes but nothing that matches with mine, esp. in older households"
12/31/19,16:28,AJoshi,In younger groups I'm the guy who drifts around everywhere
12/31/19,16:29,AJoshi,Sometimes I pick something enjoyable and let it fascinate me
12/31/19,16:29,AJoshi,"One of the biggest issues with being a creative: how the fuck do you monetize your creativity? It's really really difficult, especially in societies like ours (Kenya) with no traditional spaces for creatives"
12/31/19,16:30,AJoshi,"In India, for example, we have thousands of years of traditions of creatives (priest class -incidentally I'm a part of it)"
12/31/19,16:32,AJoshi,"The priest class mainly did religion and philosophy. Society was obligated to support the priest class by giving them alms (essentially beggars), payment for religious rituals (of which we have thousands 😄). "
12/31/19,16:33,AJoshi,I'll try much harder to spread my writing out if I move. Hopefully my dreamy style plus the Canadian community spirit will allows me to monetize my writing and research interests. 
12/31/19,16:33,AJoshi,#dreams🙂
12/31/19,16:34,AJoshi,A week to chill out 🤞🏼 and work on your stuff

12/31/19,16:36,AJoshi,"Imagine that. Your lifetime plus three more. Nothing I do has meaning in the grand scheme of my own life, let alone the universe's life 😂😭"
12/31/19,16:37,AJoshi,I already have too much to read but I'd like to do some Nietzsche soon

12/31/19,17:28,AJoshi,<Media omitted>

1/5/20,11:53,AJoshi,"Yeah true, they're common archetypes. On a similar note Joseph Campbell researched 100s of stories and found common patterns they followed although he was more concerned with mythology"
1/5/20,11:54,AJoshi,"True, I've never related with African literature and I don't know if many Africans do either"
1/5/20,11:55,AJoshi,"You should, you never know when you could go viral"
1/5/20,11:55,AJoshi,What did you have against the Internet?
1/5/20,12:05,AJoshi,Someone pulled him and he slapped her hand then apologized for it
1/5/20,12:07,AJoshi,I watched it because of the hype and it actually lived up to it😁 praise from this harsh film critic is rare but does show up sometimes

1/9/20,21:10,AJoshi,What meditation have you tried?
1/9/20,21:10,AJoshi,Do you want to set up a website?
1/9/20,21:22,Elva Wilky,Well..just something to store all my  writings
1/9/20,21:24,Elva Wilky,"Same thing,,"
1/9/20,21:25,Elva Wilky,Mmh reper...... what now😅
1/9/20,21:27,Elva Wilky,Yeah am possibly cursed my the cupid mage
1/9/20,21:29,Elva Wilky,~Bath day suit with name tattooed on your butt~ 
1/9/20,21:34,Elva Wilky,"Woww,, you and the net have formed a cordial online rship."
1/10/20,12:32,AJoshi,"Yes. You won't pass that capacity if you're storing text, if you're storing audio or video the possibility is there. "
1/10/20,12:34,AJoshi,I had the same issue but doing it for close to two weeks now I can easily reach 10 minutes without my mind running away. And you learn interesting things about yourself as you keep going. For example yesterday I figured out that my mind is not my breath - I wasn't able to actualize the separation between the two before that
1/10/20,12:34,AJoshi,"If my holy books and modern day science both agree about how important meditation is, who am I to disagree?"
1/10/20,12:34,AJoshi,"I haven't heard of a single person who's meditated for long periods of time and turned out worse off, have you?"
1/10/20,12:35,AJoshi,😂😂
1/10/20,12:35,AJoshi,<Media omitted>

1/10/20,12:38,Elva Wilky,Great! That's encouraging 
1/10/20,12:39,Elva Wilky,Hardly.
1/10/20,12:39,Elva Wilky,Indeed
1/10/20,12:40,Elva Wilky,That's cool..I'll borrow some of your interesting repertoire items🤓

1/10/20,13:50,AJoshi,Cats vs dogs?
1/10/20,13:50,AJoshi,I want to kill you and take your place 😂😂
1/10/20,13:50,AJoshi,"Not much, I finished Earthly Powers and started reading Meditations by Marcus Aurelius"
1/10/20,13:51,AJoshi,His words really resonate with me
1/10/20,13:53,AJoshi,It's the private journal of a Roman emperor who lived in the 2nd century. He didn't expect to publish it but luckily his words survived in Greek
1/10/20,13:53,AJoshi,"And today, almost 2000 years later, I read them and relate unexpectedly profoundly with them"
1/10/20,13:54,AJoshi,<Media omitted>
1/10/20,13:54,AJoshi,I thought you were talking about another kind of kitty in a box 😂
1/10/20,14:45,Elva Wilky,Lol...what other kind is there😅🤷‍♀
1/10/20,14:46,Elva Wilky,Both cats  and dogs still rule my pet mom heart.
1/10/20,14:48,Elva Wilky,He hee is all right.
1/10/20,14:50,Elva Wilky,Oh am six pages from finishing Voices..
1/10/20,14:51,Elva Wilky,"Niice,,"
1/10/20,14:52,Elva Wilky,Yeah that's the power of books and knowledge.
1/10/20,14:57,Elva Wilky,That's intriguing!
1/10/20,14:57,AJoshi,The meme where the girl gives the guy her kitty as a present 
1/10/20,14:58,AJoshi,If you had to choose between one...
1/10/20,14:58,AJoshi,I'll fuck you to death
1/10/20,14:59,AJoshi,👏👏
1/10/20,14:59,AJoshi,I feel sad that I don't read as much nowadays
1/10/20,15:00,AJoshi,Wait from October it's probably more
1/10/20,15:00,AJoshi,"Yeah, can you imagine?"
1/10/20,15:00,AJoshi,🤯🤯
1/10/20,15:02,Elva Wilky,He hee 😃😄😄😄
1/10/20,15:03,Elva Wilky,Oooh 😅
1/10/20,15:04,Elva Wilky,Gosh! You'd never ask a moma her favorite child!?
1/10/20,15:05,Elva Wilky,"Mmh,,"
1/10/20,15:06,Elva Wilky,I've only read two...voices and the Christian book
1/10/20,15:06,Elva Wilky,Woww...so it would have been more
1/10/20,15:08,Elva Wilky,"Yeah,,"
1/10/20,15:08,Elva Wilky,Wow still baffles me.
1/10/20,15:59,AJoshi,"Exactly, that's the one"
1/10/20,15:59,AJoshi,"Death over dishonor, makes sense? 😀"
1/10/20,16:00,AJoshi,Sometimes simple and brutal is the way to go 😎
1/10/20,16:01,AJoshi,It's still a book so it definitely counts 💯💯
1/10/20,16:03,AJoshi,A lot lot more 
1/10/20,16:13,Elva Wilky,😌😌😌indeed

1/10/20,16:53,AJoshi,Because they take fucking long to get you the food lol 
1/10/20,16:53,AJoshi,It's a word because I made it one 🚀
1/10/20,16:54,AJoshi,I still remember the horny high you 😂😂 you were burning up on the inside
1/10/20,16:54,AJoshi,Oh you have no idea 😮
1/10/20,16:54,AJoshi,I thought you read Voices when high once
1/10/20,16:56,Elva Wilky,"Really, i hardly remember..wouldnt call that read."
1/10/20,16:58,Elva Wilky,He hee
1/10/20,16:59,Elva Wilky,You don't remember nuthin

1/10/20,17:03,Elva Wilky,😄😄😄
1/10/20,17:09,Elva Wilky,"Yeah often,,"
1/10/20,17:18,Elva Wilky,"Ironically, "
1/10/20,19:37,Elva Wilky,Read it twice..😅
1/10/20,19:38,Elva Wilky,It's the book at Quadi by River Quanova/Hron...
1/10/20,19:48,Elva Wilky,"Correct me if wrong,,"
1/10/20,19:51,Elva Wilky,"The second part is my best,,"
1/10/20,20:57,AJoshi,It was probably a reference to something... I haven't talked to a pretty chic in a month 🙁
1/10/20,20:59,AJoshi,Or that would have been the end of thy virginity 😂😂
1/10/20,20:59,AJoshi,`I was not told that that much lol 
1/10/20,21:00,AJoshi,That's a very nice philosophy 😀
1/10/20,21:01,AJoshi,I admire that
1/10/20,21:03,AJoshi,"Probably the case, we don't have much context because he seems to retreat into himself when writing the Meditations"
1/10/20,21:03,AJoshi,Imagine being the emperor of the most powerful empire in the world 😀
1/10/20,21:06,AJoshi,I think he focuses too much on his rationality at the expense of his emotion - I worry I do the same😦
1/10/20,21:10,AJoshi,What do you think?
1/10/20,21:11,Elva Wilky,Not really..I would have teased you beyond levels 10😅😜
1/10/20,21:12,Elva Wilky,He hee..nowonder you loath running
1/10/20,21:12,Elva Wilky,🙌
1/10/20,21:13,Elva Wilky,Just from night jog!...
1/10/20,21:16,Elva Wilky,Yeah he's so conc
1/10/20,21:19,Elva Wilky,The Roman Empire!
1/10/20,21:22,Elva Wilky,I think you experiencing the fear of having nihilism...
1/10/20,21:32,Elva Wilky,"In context of being emotionally irrational at the expense to being rational myself,,"
1/10/20,21:33,Elva Wilky,"Writing is such a gift, and burden"
1/10/20,21:34,Elva Wilky,Quick question...
1/10/20,22:18,AJoshi,Oh no 😮
1/10/20,22:19,AJoshi,"Btw you asked me about my 2020 stuff, I've also been jogging for the past couple of days - I want to make it a habit. Especially running in Nyeri is really hard, I think because of altitude. My lungs always burn after running, which I didn't experience in India. "
1/10/20,22:19,AJoshi,But then it's something your body gets used to if you do it often enough like (stereotypically) the people of Kipchoge's tribe
1/10/20,22:21,AJoshi,"I watched a Gujarati movie with my parents - apparently the Gujarati movie industry is really rising, which was news to me 😀 Bollywood movies are in Hindi btw and massive regional markets also exist to cater to regional markets in their mother tongues"
1/10/20,22:21,AJoshi,What are you up to?
1/10/20,22:21,Elva Wilky,Yes..esp during my third lap
1/10/20,22:22,AJoshi,"Yeah, it seems that way. He speaks about his journaling as his inner retreat. I think he refers to being in a place where he can ""dip into the calmness of self"" (paraphrasing him) at the end of the day"
1/10/20,22:22,Elva Wilky,Watching YouTube saved videos..laughs
1/10/20,22:23,AJoshi,"Marcus Aurelius was one of the persecutors of the Christians, btw, he even refers to their ""theatrics"" in Meditations"
1/10/20,22:25,AJoshi,"I do think I have emotions and I can choose to follow them, but it never seems to lead to anything good, especially in the context of people."
1/10/20,22:27,AJoshi,"Ego death is something completely different, btw, it feels like a death but isn't exactly death"
1/10/20,22:28,AJoshi,"I do - I did a program called Transformation Mastery that was all about the technical process of feeling i.e. close your eyes, relax, let your sensations just be, don't try to label, correct, or interact with them, just let them be"
1/10/20,22:28,AJoshi,But in day to day life I don't rely on emotions for decision making
1/10/20,22:28,AJoshi,You're right in that it causes nihilism since it's our subjective experience that gives meaning to life
1/10/20,22:31,Elva Wilky,It's very true...😃I've experienced that..after one and a half week of jogging consistently!
1/10/20,22:33,Elva Wilky,"That's true...my cuzo really watches these movies,, sometimes I end up watching too..overseeing the subtitle issue"

1/10/20,23:13,Elva Wilky,Ok
1/10/20,23:13,Elva Wilky,###
1/11/20,09:35,AJoshi,"His religion was pagan, Jupiter and Venus and Mercury and the rest and it left a lot of room for spirituality"
1/11/20,09:35,AJoshi,Although things improved spectacularly after the Second Vatican Council
1/11/20,09:35,AJoshi,"According to Pope Benedict XVI, the most important and essential message of the council is ""the Paschal Mystery as the center of what it is to be Christian and therefore of the Christian life, the Christian year, the Christian seasons"".[4] Other changes which followed the council included the widespread use of vernacular languages in the Mass instead of Latin, the subtle disuse of ornate clerical regalia, the revision of Eucharistic (liturgical) prayers, the abbreviation of the liturgical calendar, the ability to celebrate the Mass versus populum (with the officiant facing the congregation), as well as ad orientem (facing the ""East"" and the Crucifix), and modern aesthetic changes encompassing contemporary Catholic liturgical music and artwork. Many of these changes remain divisive among the Catholic faithful.["
1/11/20,09:36,AJoshi,How's the weather in Nairobi?..👀
1/11/20,09:38,AJoshi,"Sure, I can do yours 😀"
1/11/20,09:38,AJoshi,I've forgotten the technical terms 😭
1/11/20,09:40,AJoshi,"You wouldn't end up losing anything, only gaining stuff"
1/11/20,09:40,AJoshi,"This is where Jung and another contemporary philosopher, Ken Wilbur, disagree"
1/11/20,09:41,AJoshi,"He has a whole section on the levels of consciousness, it's very interesting 💯"
1/11/20,09:41,AJoshi,...

1/11/20,22:06,AJoshi,I had to look it up 😂
1/11/20,22:07,AJoshi,Otherwise your sect might still be at war with Catholicism
1/11/20,22:10,AJoshi,Did you know wars have been fought because of this? 
1/11/20,22:10,AJoshi,Wars were fought between Catholic and Protestant countries simply because of their opposing beliefs 
1/11/20,22:25,Elva Wilky,😃😃😃..nice
1/11/20,22:26,Elva Wilky,Is this from the MBTI book?

1/14/20,16:52,AJoshi,It's exactly what being an empath is - you pick up on other people's emotions
1/14/20,16:53,AJoshi,"Yeah, I also have a soft copy 😀"
1/14/20,16:53,AJoshi,That's called having a good memory
